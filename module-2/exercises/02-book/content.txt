1. Markup languages

A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.

Types of markup languages

- Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).
- Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).
- Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).

1.2. HTML

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.

1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML

1. The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.
2. The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.
3. A layout is generated from the render tree.
4. The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.
