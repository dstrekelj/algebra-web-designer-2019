1. Create a new HTML document named `index.html`.
2. Outline the document using the base HTML elements.
3. Set the title of the document to "Canvas art".
4. Use SVG elements to create a face. Use `face.jpg` as a reference.

Note: you do not have to copy `face.jpg`. Create something similar, use your own colours and prefered shapes. The end result however must display a face.
