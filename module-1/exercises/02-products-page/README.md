## Assignment

> This assignment is a continuation of [Figma Exercises / Product Card](../01-product-card/README.md).

You are tasked with designing a web shop for a fashion brand.

Your second assignment is to design a page presenting a list or grid of products belonging to a specific product category.

The following information is available:

- category name;
- category breadcrumbs;
- category products.

Additionally, the page must contain the following structural elements:

- a header with a menu, search, cart, and logo;
- a footer with the copyright year and holder.

The design must solve the problem of product pagination:

- how many products are visible "per page";
- how products are paginated;
- how the number of visible and total products will be presented to the user.

Populate the products page with the product cards created in the previous assignment. Adjust the product card design to fit with the rest of the products page.

Using the provided information, design a products page for use on mobile phones.

Write a short paragraph explaining your design and the choices you made in the design process. Provide arguments for and against design choices.

### Deliverables

To complete the assignment, deliver a Figma project file containing the following:

- one products page design.

### Tips, tricks, and notes

- Limit your canvas size to match a smaller mobile phone, such as the iPhone SE (320 x 568 px) and resize the canvas vertically as necessary
- Research how different web shops apply different pagination mechanisms (e.g. numbered pages, "show more" triggers, loading while scrolling) and how that impacts user experience
- Research how different webs shops organise header and footer elements on mobile phones
- Breadcrumbs usually depend on categorisation, so feel free to think of something (e.g. Home > Men's > Shirts) or use an example from researched web shops
