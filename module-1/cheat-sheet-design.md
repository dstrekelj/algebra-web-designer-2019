**Elements of visual communication**

* Line
* Colour
* Shape
* Form
* Value
* Space
* Texture

**Principles of good design**

* Contrast
* Balance
* Emphasis / focal point
* Unity / harmony
* Rhythm / pattern
* Movement

**Gestalt theory**

* Simplicity - We perceive elements in the most easiest way possible.
* Similarity - We perceive elements as belonging to the same group if they look like each other.
* Proximity - We perceive objects or shapes that are close to one another to form groups.
* Closure - When we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.
* Figure / ground - We discern elements in focus as the "figure", and elements out of focus as the "ground".
* Continuity - Elements that are arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.
* Order and symmetry - Symmetrical elements are perceived as part of the same group.
* Synchronicity / Common fate - We perceive visual elements that move in the same speed and/or direction as parts of a single stimulus.

**Colour**

Colour implies order and organisation. Colour demands attention and invokes emotion.

Colours are organised in colour spaces:

* RGB - Red, green, blue. Additive colour space, mixing all colours results in white. Used in digital media.
* CMYK - Cyan, magenta, yellow, key (black). Subtractive colour space, mixing all colours results in black. Used in print media.
* HSV - Hue, Saturation, Value. Similar to human colour perception.
* HSL - Hue, Saturation, Lightness. Similar to human colour perception.
* HEX - Hexadecimal notation. Red, green, blue channel values mapped to a range of 0 - 255, written down as hexadecimal triplets (e.g. #A1B2C3).

**Typography**

Typography communicates tone and impacts readability and visual hierarchy of content.

A font is a collection of glyphs (e.g. letter, number, symbol) in a certain style and size.

A series of fonts in different styles (e.g. italic, bold) belonging to the same family creates a font family.

The four types of fonts are: serif, sans-serif, display, script.

The modular scale ensures a vertical rhythm and hierarchy for typography.

**Images**

Images demand attention and communicate information.

Vector graphics are lossless and intended for illustrations. The format for vector graphics is SVG.

Raster graphics are lossy and intended for images. The most common formats are JPEG, PNG, GIF.

**Web design steps**

1. Research.
2. Wireframing.
3. Design.
4. Development.
